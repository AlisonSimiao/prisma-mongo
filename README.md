# Prisma Example

This is the Prisma example, created from the [Prisma Guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart). Here's some pointers to get started:

- Check [script.ts](./script.ts) to see how you can use Prisma to query
- Check [prisma/schema.prisma](./prisma/schema.prisma) to learn how the schema is built up
- Check out the [Prisma Studio](http://localhost:5555) to learn how the data is set up
- Run `npx ts-node script.ts` to run the script, you can also change it first if you want to

If you want to play with the code, make sure to fork this sandbox by clicking "Fork" in the top right corner.
